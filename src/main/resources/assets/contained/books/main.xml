<title>Introduction</title>
<text>Contained is a mod that provides many different features to allow players to work together in groups. There are two primary components to the game world. The first is the "lobby" dimension, which is the main long-term area of the server where you spend time building, exploring, etc, like a traditional survival Minecraft server. The second is the "mini-game" dimensions, which are short-term dimensions where you compete in teams to win rare prizes that you can use in the lobby dimension.

<title>Mini-Games</title>
<text>§lPress 'L' To Access The Mini Games Lobby. Press join to queue yourself; once enough people in the server are queued, the mini-game will automatically start.§r

Mini-games are short competitive games between two groups of players. They are also a fast way to get good items to use in the lobby dimension; regardless of whether your team wins or loses the game, you are awarded some prizes. Of course, the winning team's prizes are of much better quality and rarity. 

There are two mini games: PVP and Treasure Hunt.

<title>PVP Mini-Game</title>
<text>§lWinning Conditions§r
1. Steal all of the other team's territory.
2. Kill off all of the players on the other team.
3. Have the most kills at the end of the timer.

<title>PVP Mini-Game</title>
<text>In this game, your team is automatically given a small square area of territory; this territory cannot be expanded. Each player in your team is given a small set of lives. If you run out of lives, you will enter a spectating mode where you can continue watching the game, but can no longer participate. The Apple of Life item can be used to give yourself an extra life, and the Stick of Life item can be used to revive one of your teammates who has lost all of their lives.

<title>Treasure Hunt Mini-Game</title>
<text>§lWinning Conditions§r
1. Activate 3 out of the 4 Emblem Altars.
2. Have the most collected chests at the end of the timer.

PvP is disabled in this game. Instead, the goal of this game is to loot as many treasure chests in the world as possible. Each chest contains a fragment of an emblem, which are important to activate the "altars" that spawn in your team's territory. Chests contain many other useful items as well. You may sometimes find spawn eggs in chests, which can be used to summon friendly monsters that help your team.

<title>The Guilds</title>
<text>§lPress 'G' To Access The Guild Interface§r

Players can either join a guild or create their own. To create a guild, type in a unique name and select a color, then press the 'Create' button. The color you select will be used to highlight territories that you claim and highlight messages from your teammates. Guilds are allowed to have a maximum of 5 players on their teams and players are able to share a private chat log between each other (by typing "/t message" in chat).

<title>Guild Leaders</title>
<text>A leader of a guild can access several tabs from the guild interface. From these tabs, the leader can promote or demote players in the guild, or kick players out of the guild. The leader can also invite more players into the guild, if the guild has not reached the maximum members limit. The leader can also change the guilds' name and color. 
</text>

<page type="cleansectionpage">
<title>Territory Flag</title>
<text>This is an item usable only by guild leaders. It allows you to start a single block of land as your territory, which you and your guild members can later expand off of. There are no restrictions on where you can use this, as long as the block is not already owned by another guild. The first time use of the flag is free, but each subsequent use requires spending 15 experience levels. </text>

<title>Town Hall</title>
<text>This is an important block that every guild should have. It enables the purchasing and managing of various things that will be essential for the growth and success of the guild's territory.

§lTerritory Purchasing:§r This tab allows you to spend experience levels in order to purchase items that will allow you to expand your guild's territory, as well as take over other guilds' territories, if you so desire.

§lNPC Purchasing:§r This tab allows you to spend experience levels and emeralds to spawn villagers in your territory.

<text>§lPermissions:§r This tab allows you to view (or if you're a team leader, to modify) the permissions that other teams have within your territory.

§lTrades:§r This tab allows you to put some of your items up for trade with other people on the server, or to see any active trades other people have posted.

<title>Territory Gems</title>
<text>One-time use item that allows acquisition of a single extra block of territory… but it must be one that’s directly adjacent to the land your guild already owns.

The Anti-gem is similar, except it allows you to remove a block of another (specific) guild’s territory. It must be territory at the very edge/perimeter of that guild’s land. Using one on your own territory refunds you experience levels.

Anti-gems drop when you kill
a player from another guild.

<text>Unlimited use versions of the territory gems, that passively claim/remove land for you over time. You place the machine into the world, and it very slowly converts land within a small radius. The machines are confined to the same restrictions as the territory gems; for example, they can only claim land directly adjacent to your current territory.</text>

<title>Occupational Classes Pt.1</title>
<text>§lPress 'P' To Access The Occupations Class Interface§r
You have the option of selecting a occupational class to specialize in: Collector, Builder, Cook, Wizard, or Warrior. By collecting specific items in the world, you can level up each one of the classes. You will be able to select a total of four different perks, but be wary of the perks you choose because when you select a perk, then you can only select that perks' child perks when leveling up again. It is highly recommended to select an occupation that you think can best matches your playstyle and can best help your guild; having a diverse group of players in a guild can be beneficial.
