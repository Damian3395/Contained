<title>Guild Leader Pt.1</title>
<text>A leader of a guild can access three tabs in the guild interface: actions, teammates, and settings tabs.

§lActions Tab:§r This tab allows the leader to access diplomacy actions with other guilds on the server. The leader can also use it to set tasks for the guild members to accomplish to earn experience points for the town hall. Earning experience points will help the your guild purchase NPCs, items, and blocks from the town hall, which can give you advantages over other guilds.
</text>
</page>

<page type="sectionpage">
<title>Guild Leader Pt.2</title>
<text>§lTeam-mate Tab:§r This tab allows the leader to promote or demote a player in the guild, but the leader can also use it to kick a player out of the guild. If the guild leader demotes himself/herself, then another guild member who was promoted will become the guild leader.

§lSettings Tab:§r If the guild has not reached the maximum members limit, the leader can invite more players into the guild. The leader can also change the guilds' name and color.

<title>Territory Flag</title>
<text>This is an item usable only by guild leaders. It allows you to start a single block of land as your territory, which you and your guild members can later expand off of. There are no restrictions on where you can use this, as long as the block is not already owned by another guild. The first time use of the flag is free, but subsequent uses require a steep amount of experience levels. </text>

<text>This is an important block that every guild should have. It enables the purchasing and managing of various things that will be essential for the growth and success of the players' town.

§lTerritory Purchasing:§r This tab allows you to spend experience levels in order to purchase items that will allow you to expand your guild's territory, as well as take over other guilds' territories, if you so desire.

<title>Territory Gems</title>
<text>One-time use item that allows acquisition of a single extra block of territory… but it must be one that’s directly adjacent to the land your guild already owns.

The Anti-gem is similar, except it allows you to remove a block of another (specific) guild’s territory. It must be territory at the very edge/perimeter of that guild’s land. Using one on your own territory refunds you experience levels.

Anti-gems drop when you kill
a player from another guild.

<title>Territory Machines</title>
<text>Unlimited use versions of the territory gems, that passively claim/remove land for you over time. You place the machine into the world, and it very slowly converts land within a small radius. The machines are confined to the same restrictions as the territory gems; for example, they can only claim land directly adjacent to your current territory.</text>

<title>Occupational Classes Pt.1</title>
<text>§lPress 'P' To Access The Occupations Class Interface§r
You have the option of selecting a occupational class to specialize in: Collector, Builder, Cook, Wizard, and Warrior. By collecting specific items in the world, you can level up each one of the classes. You will be able to select a total of four different perks, but be wary of the perks you choose because when you select a perk, then you can only select that perks' child perks when leveling up again. It is highly recommended to select an occupation in order to gain advantages over other players and to give guild leaders an incentive to invite you into their guild.
